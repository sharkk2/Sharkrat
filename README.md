# Sharkrat (Deprecated)
A very simple remote access tool developed in python with implementations with discord


# Setup

1. Make a discord bot and fill the config in bot/config.py
2. Setup an open port, and host the bot. Then put the bot's websocket IP in remote/sharkblocks.py
3. Use pyinstaller to turn the remote folder into a .exe
4. Thats it
